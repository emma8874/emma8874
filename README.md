Hello! I'm Emma, a Network Operations Specialist transitioning into the exciting world of data analysis and analytics. With a strong foundation in networking and IT infrastructure, I am passionate about leveraging data to drive informed decision-making and optimize operations. 

Over the years, I've honed my technical skills and developed a keen eye for detail, enabling me to troubleshoot complex network issues and ensure seamless connectivity. Now, I am eager to apply these analytical skills to data-driven projects, uncovering insights and trends that can propel businesses forward.

I have been actively expanding my knowledge in data analysis, mastering tools such as R, SQL, and various data visualization platforms. My goal is to combine my technical expertise with data analytics to solve real-world problems, enhance performance, and contribute to strategic planning.
